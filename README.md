# FORCE-learning-Sussillo-Abbott
Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks


In 2009, David Sussillo and L.F. Abbott published an article [[1]](#1) presenting a procedure called FORCE learning, used to study and take advantage of the relationship between spontaneous and stimulus-triggered neural activity. In this project, this procedure is modelled on a network controlled only by feedback.
